= Beetle

Beetle is a somewhat higher level Java API on top of the client libraries
distributed distributed with link:http://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka]. The
goal of this library is not to replace the use of those libraries, but to wrap
the library in a more easy to use package.


== System Requirements

* JDK7 or later


== Hacking

This project uses link:http://gradle.org[Gradle] so building and testing should
be as easy as executing:

    % ./gradlew
